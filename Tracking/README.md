We need to keep a log of what we do, as it is, primary, what we're judged upon.

"Please include as much detail as possible in your Devpost submission, as this is primarily what we'll be judging off.
Videos, screenshots and access to your repos is also very helpful for our judges and will be favourable for you."

So, I've added some files so we can start tracking.
